# Dots

Here're all of my configuration files I used every day. Managed by [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).

### Programs I use

I use mostly common programs that you are probably familiar of. But I also use some custom software, check it out in [pnpkgs](https://github.com/pniedzwiedzinski/pnpkgs).
